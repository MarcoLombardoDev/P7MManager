"""Inventory the third-party code P7M Manager actually ships, and what licenses it.

THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md is generated from this script rather than written by
hand, because a hand-written list of a PyInstaller bundle is wrong the day
after it is written: PyInstaller collects whatever the build machine's linker
resolved, so the list changes when the runner image changes, not when anyone
edits the repository.

The script walks an *extracted* release bundle — the artefact users download,
not the build tree — and attributes every native binary in it to the thing
that put it there:

  wheel   a Python wheel vendored it — here that means Qt, and little else
  cpython the interpreter and its stdlib extension modules
  system  PyInstaller collected it from the build machine's own libraries

**Almost all of it is Qt.** P7M Manager declares one runtime dependency,
PySide6, because the engine under ``p7mmanager/core/`` is written against the
standard library: the ASN.1, CMS and X.509 readers pull in nothing. That makes
this inventory short and the one thing in it that matters large — Qt is
LGPL-3.0, which is a set of additional permissions on top of GPL-3.0 and
carries obligations the permissive licences in the other products do not.

Only the third class needs looking up, and on a Debian-family host dpkg knows
the answer: which package owns the file, and what that package's copyright
file says.

Two warnings about that lookup, both learned the hard way and both the reason
this script exists instead of a one-line shell pipeline.

The first: a debian/copyright file lists every licence appearing anywhere in
the *source* package, including test fixtures and build scripts. Reporting
that union is alarmist nonsense — it makes GLib look like it has a GPL-2+
term. What governs a shipped shared library is the licence of that library's
own sources, which in a machine-readable copyright file is the stanza whose
``Files:`` pattern covers them.

The second: even the ``Files: *`` stanza is not that licence when the source
package builds several libraries under different terms. util-linux's default
stanza says GPL-2+, but the libraries P7M Manager ships from it — libblkid, libmount,
libuuid — carry LGPL-2.1+, LGPL-2.1+ and BSD-3-clause in their own stanzas.
Taking the default would have published three wrong answers.

So: the default stanza is a starting point, REVIEWED below is where a human
looked at the sub-stanza and recorded what it actually said, and anything the
script cannot resolve is reported as unresolved rather than guessed. A gap you
can see is worth more than a plausible-looking entry that is wrong.

Usage:

    python tools/licence_inventory.py --bundle linux=/path/to/extracted/P7M Manager
    python tools/licence_inventory.py --bundle linux=... --json out.json

Run it on a host of the same family as the release runner (Ubuntu, for the
Linux bundle) — otherwise the system-library lookup has nothing to consult and
every such library is reported unresolved.
